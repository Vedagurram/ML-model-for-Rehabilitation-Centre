# Machine Learning Model for Tracking and Predicting Progression in Patients with Left Hemiparesis
## Abstract
The goal of this study was to develop a machine learning model capable of tracking and predicting the progression of patients with left hemiparesis. The methodology included comprehensive data preprocessing to ensure consistency and quality. Furthermore, synthetic data generation using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) was employed to enhance the dataset. The augmented data was normalized using MinMaxScaler for improved model performance. A multi-output regression model was constructed using Random Forest, XGBoost, and Support Vector Regression (SVR) within a StackingRegressor framework. Hyperparameter tuning via RandomizedSearchCV was applied to optimize model performance. The resulting model demonstrates robust capabilities in forecasting patient improvement, thereby supporting the long-term objectives of tailored treatment programs, enhanced rehabilitation procedures, and improved patient outcomes.
